# WinProxyManager
A GUI based tool (windows users only) to change proxy with just one click. 
(Especially, for IIESTians some of the common proxy addresses are already loaded, so no need to remember anymore)

## Instal

If you have python installed then just run the following commands(faster way):

1. To install the dependencies 

```$ pip install winregistry```
or
```$ pip -m install winregistry```

2. Now just run WinProxyManager.pyw by double clicking on it

Also you can directly download the exe file from [here](https://github.com/arnabsen1729/WinProxyManager/releases/download/v1.0/WinProxyMan.exe) and execute it. (But Windows Defender might tag it as a virus, just because it is chaning proxy address smh)
